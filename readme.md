## Node.js Homework

There I learn a MondoDB, used MondoDB Compass and Mongoose.

That is the backend app where user can saves her/his/their contacts and filters her/his/their contacts.
User must be verified. User confirmation letter will be sent to his mail.

I'm making frontend part this app now.
